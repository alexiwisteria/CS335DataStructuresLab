<h1>Assignment #9 - Stack on LinkedList</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This assignment is to implement a Stack using a LinkedList as the backing construct.

This assignment will utilize the following components:

- Generics
- LinkedList class
- List interface

<h2>Assignment</h2>

Your assignment will be to implement the following methods for the StackOnLinkedList implementation class:

    void push(T o)

    T pop()

    T peek()

    int getSize()

    String toString()

    boolean isEmpty()

You will need to ensure the unit tests pass (NOTE: Unit tests are already implemented.)

<b>NOTE:</b> You shoulld only have to modify the StackOnLinkedListImpl.java file.

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
Once you have successfully complete your code (it must both compile and pass the unit tests), run the following:

mvn clean

The <b>goal</b> of this assignment is two-fold:

<b>
1 - Understand how the Stack functions.<br/>
2 - Learn the API of the LinkedList class (while coding against the List interface)
</b>
