<h1>Assignment #10 - Queue on LinkedList</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This assignment is to implement a Queue using a LinkedList as the backing construct.

This assignment will utilize the following components:

- Generics
- LinkedList class
- List interface

<h2>Assignment</h2>

Your assignment will be to implement the following methods for the StackOnLinkedList implementation class:

    boolean isEmpty()

    int getSize()

    void clear()

    void enqueue(T t)

    T dequeue()

    T peekFront()

    T peekLast()

You will need to ensure the unit tests pass (NOTE: Unit tests are already implemented.)

<b>NOTE:</b> You shoulld only have to modify the QueueOnLinkedListImpl.java file.

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
Once you have successfully complete your code (it must both compile and pass the unit tests), run the following:

mvn clean

And then zip up your source code into a single file using the following naming convention:

CS335-Assignment10-Binch.zip

and upload your file to Canvas.

The <b>goal</b> of this assignment is two-fold:

<b>
1 - Understand how the Queue functions.<br/>
2 - Learn the API of the LinkekdList class (while coding against the List interface)
</b>

Be sure to fill out the below information:

Class: CS335 - Data Structures


<b>NOTE:</b> Don't forget to include your JavaDocs for the public classes and methods.
