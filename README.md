# CS335 Data Structures

This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures for the CS335 course. Each folder explores a different data structure or algorithm, with code examples and comments to make concepts easy to follow.

## Repository Structure

- **dynamic array**: Dynamic array implementation that grows as more elements are added.
- **array iteration**: Methods for iterating over arrays, including basic and enhanced for-loops.
- **sorting complex objects**: Sorting objects with multiple properties using custom comparators.
- **stable sort**: Stable sorting algorithm that maintains the order of equal elements.
- **recursive sort**: Recursive sorting example, like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
- **interfaces**: Demonstrates how to use interfaces in Java with practical examples.
- **linked list**: Implementation and examples of Linked List data structures. 
- **stack**: Implementation of stack operations (push, pop, peek) using arrays or linked lists. 
- **queue**: Queue implementation with examples of enqueue and dequeue operations. 
- **hashmaps**: HashMap implementation, showcasing key-value pairs, collision handling, and use cases.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexiwisteria/CS335_DataStructures.git
cd CS335_DataStructures
```

### Run Code
1. Go to the folder for the data structure or algorithm you'd like to explore.
2. Compile and run the Java file for each example.

Example:
```bash
cd dynamic-array
javac DynamicArray.java
java DynamicArrayMain
```

## Requirements

- **Java 21** (latest release) installed on your machine
- **Maven** (latest release) if you want to use the `pom.xml` for building
