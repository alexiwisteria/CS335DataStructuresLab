<h1>Assignment #8 - Singly Linked List</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This assignment is to implement the methods for a singly linked list.

This assignment will utilize the following components:

- Generics
- Singly Linked Lists

<h2>Assignment</h2>

Your assignment will be to implement the following methods for the SinglyLinkedList implementation class:
int getSize();

    int getCount();

    boolean isEmpty();

    void insertTail(T data);

    void insertNth(T data, int index);

    void insertHead(T data);

    boolean contains(T data);

    T getNth(int index);

    boolean deleteTail();

    boolean deleteHead();

    boolean deleteNth(int index);

    String toString();

    void clear();

You will need to ensure the unit tests pass (NOTE: Unit tests are already implemented.)

<b>NOTE:</b> You shoulld only have to modify the SinglyLinkedListImpl.java file.

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
Once you have successfully complete your code (it must both compile and pass the unit tests), run the following:

mvn clean

And then zip up your source code into a single file using the following naming convention:

CS335-Assignment8-Binch.zip

and upload your file to Canvas.

Be sure to fill out the below information:

Class: CS335 Data Structures


<b>NOTE:</b> Don't forget to include your JavaDocs for the public classes and methods.
